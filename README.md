## A starter FastAPI template

This FastAPI template attempts to be a barebones, easy-to-use and easy-to-understand starting point for your applications.

It features:

- Database configuration (works with PostgreSQL)
- Files for logging configuration and custom exceptions
- Auth setup with JWT
- A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.ym` for deployments

Sensitive or environment-specific variables should be contained in an `.env` file.
